Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

It applies to inheritance in such a way that the derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes. In other words, if class A
is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interrupting the behaviour of the program.

Example: Suppose I have a abstract class called SocialMedia, which contains all the functionality that we do in social media(like chatWithFriends, 
sendPhotoAndVideo, publishPosts, groupVideoCall). Suppose there are multiple clients for this SocialMedia class, like Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp.
Now if we build a class called Facebook and extends the SocialMedia class, and implements all the methods of the SocialMedia class (becz SocialMedia class is abstract),
then we can say that Facebook(base class) is a substitute of SocialMedia(parent)
Now say we create a Whatsapp class that also extends the SocialMedia class, and implements all the methods of the SocialMedia class. But the thing is
whatsapp dont have the functionality to publish posts, but since we have extended the SocialMedia class so we had to override the publishPosts method
in Whatsapp class. This means that Whatsapp cannot be a substitute of SocialMedia. Therefore it doesnot support LSP.
Similarly if we create a class called Instagram that also extends the SocialMedia class, and implements all the methods of the SocialMedia class. 
But instagram dosent support the group video call functionality but since we have extended the SocialMedia class so we had to override the
groupVidoCall function. This means that Instagram cannot be a substitute of SocialMedia. Therefore it doesnot support LSP.

How to overcome this?
> Create an interface called SocialMedia which will only contain the common functionality of all the SocialMedia platforms, like
  chatWithFriends and sendPhotosAndVideos.
> Similarly create an interface called PostMediaManager which will contain the function to publish posts.
> Similarly create an interface called SocialVideoCallManager which will contain the function to do group video call
> Now the classes (Facebook Instagram and Whatsapp) with implement these interfaces according to what functionality they supports, like facebook
  supports all the functionality, so it will implement all the interfaces, similarly Instagram class will implement the SocialMedia and PostMediaManager interfaces.
